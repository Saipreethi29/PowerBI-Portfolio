##Projects

###1. Procurement or spend analysis

The Procurement / Spend Analysis Dashboard, built in Power BI, provides an interactive view of the companyâ€™s purchasing and spending trends. It highlights key metrics such as total purchases ($2.16B), total quantity (140M), and total purchase orders (8,367), enabling data-driven procurement decisions. The report visualizes top-performing suppliers, major spending categories, and package-wise purchase patterns while showcasing year-over-year purchase trends. This dashboard helps stakeholders identify cost-saving opportunities, evaluate supplier performance, and optimize procurement efficiency through clear, actionable insights.

On the next page, a metrics slicer is used. When one of the metric options is selected, the visualizations display trends based on that value.
